# zomboid-automated-test-framework
A simple framework for writing unit tests for your Project Zomboid mods.

See the example tests for how to create tests. Its fairly straightforward and simple. I recommend duplicating and editing BlankTest.lua as a starting point.

# Code Coverage
Although we can't do line-by-line coverage, the framework can track which functions are called during your tests for objects of your choice
